# Account Ledger System - Complete Testing Guide

## üéØ System Overview

The account ledger system now supports:
- **Dealer deposits** money to farmer accounts (credit)
- **Order flow**: Farmer orders ‚Üí Dealer approves ‚Üí Marks delivered ‚Üí Amount deducted
- **Many-to-many relationships**: Multiple dealers with multiple farmers
- **Persistent balance storage** with real-time updates
- **Atomic transactions** ensuring data consistency

## üìã Testing Prerequisites

### 1. Run Migration First
```bash
# Start dev server
bun run dev

# Open migration tool
http://localhost:5173/migrate-balances.html
```

Click "Start Migration" to populate persistent balances from existing transaction data.

### 2. Firebase Setup
- Firestore rules temporarily allow unauthenticated access for migration
- After testing, we'll secure the rules properly

## üß™ Complete Testing Flow

### Phase 1: Setup and Deposits

#### Step 1: Login as Dealer
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/dealer/orders`
2. Login with dealer credentials
3. Navigate to "Farmer Account Management" tab

#### Step 2: Deposit Money to Farmer Account
1. Find a connected farmer in the list
2. Click "Add Payment" button
3. Enter deposit amount (e.g., ‚Çπ10,000)
4. Add note: "Initial deposit for orders"
5. Click "Record Payment"
6. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Success message, balance updates immediately

#### Step 3: Verify Deposit
1. Check the farmer's balance in the dealer dashboard
2. Switch to farmer dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/farmer/dashboard`
3. Login as the farmer
4. Go to "Account Management" tab
5. ‚úÖ **Expected**: See positive balance with the dealer

### Phase 2: Order Flow Testing

#### Step 4: Farmer Places Order
1. In farmer dashboard, go to "Order Management" tab
2. Click "Request Order" for the dealer who made the deposit
3. Fill order details:
   - Order Type: Feed
   - Quantity: 100
   - Unit: bags
   - Notes: "Monthly feed requirement"
4. Submit order
5. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Order status shows "Pending"

#### Step 5: Dealer Approves Order
1. Switch to dealer dashboard: `http://localhost:5173/dealer/orders`
2. Go to "Order Requests" tab
3. Find the new order from the farmer
4. Click "Quick Approve" or "Respond" 
5. Set estimated cost (e.g., ‚Çπ8,000)
6. Add delivery notes
7. Submit approval
8. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Order status changes to "Completed", farmer balance reduced

#### Step 6: Verify Balance Deduction
1. Check dealer dashboard - farmer's balance should be reduced
2. Switch to farmer dashboard
3. Check "Account Management" tab
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: 
   - Balance reduced by order amount
   - New transaction appears in history
   - Real-time update without page refresh

### Phase 3: Multi-Dealer Testing

#### Step 7: Test Multiple Dealer Relationships
1. Login as different dealer
2. Connect with the same farmer
3. Deposit different amount (e.g., ‚Çπ5,000)
4. Verify farmer sees balances with both dealers separately

#### Step 8: Cross-Dealer Orders
1. Farmer places orders with multiple dealers
2. Each dealer approves their respective orders
3. Verify balance tracking is separate per dealer

## üîç Verification Points

### Real-time Updates
- Balance changes appear immediately without page refresh
- Both farmer and dealer dashboards sync automatically
- Transaction history updates in real-time

### Data Consistency
- Open browser console and check Firestore:
```javascript
// Check farmerBalances collection
console.log('Checking farmerBalances...');
```

### Balance Calculations
- **Positive netBalance**: Farmer owes dealer
- **Negative netBalance**: Dealer owes farmer  
- **Zero netBalance**: Accounts are balanced

### Transaction Types
- **Credit**: Dealer deposits money (increases farmer's available balance)
- **Debit**: Order completion (decreases farmer's available balance)

## üè∑Ô∏è Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Sufficient Balance
1. Dealer deposits ‚Çπ10,000
2. Farmer orders ‚Çπ8,000 worth of feed
3. ‚úÖ Order completes, balance becomes ‚Çπ2,000

### Scenario 2: Insufficient Balance
1. Farmer has ‚Çπ2,000 balance
2. Farmer orders ‚Çπ5,000 worth of medicine  
3. ‚úÖ Order still completes but creates negative balance

### Scenario 3: Multiple Transactions
1. Multiple deposits and orders with same dealer
2. ‚úÖ All transactions tracked, running balance maintained

### Scenario 4: Many-to-Many Relationships
1. Farmer A connects to Dealers X, Y, Z
2. Dealer X connects to Farmers A, B, C
3. ‚úÖ All relationships maintained separately

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Migration Fails
**Solution**: Check Firefox/Chrome console, ensure Firebase config is correct

### Issue 2: Balance Not Updating
**Solution**: Check if migration ran successfully, refresh page

### Issue 3: Permission Denied
**Solution**: Firestore rules need temporary access, already updated

### Issue 4: Real-time Updates Not Working
**Solution**: Check network connection, Firebase subscriptions

## üìä Expected Test Results

After complete testing:

1. **Dealer Dashboard** shows:
   - List of connected farmers with current balances
   - Ability to deposit money easily
   - Real-time balance updates
   - Order management with automatic deductions

2. **Farmer Dashboard** shows:
   - Balances with each connected dealer
   - Transaction history per dealer
   - Order status and balance impacts
   - Real-time updates

3. **Database (Firestore)** contains:
   - `farmerBalances` collection with persistent balances
   - `farmerTransactions` collection with all transaction records
   - Real-time synchronization between collections

## üîê Security Note

After testing, remove temporary rules from `firestore.rules`:
```javascript
// Remove these temporary rules:
match /farmerTransactions/{transactionId} {
  allow read: if true; // REMOVE THIS
}
match /farmerBalances/{balanceId} {
  allow read, write: if true; // REMOVE THIS  
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Complete all testing scenarios
2. Verify data integrity in Firestore console
3. Test with multiple users simultaneously
4. Prepare for production deployment
