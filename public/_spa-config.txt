# Nginx configuration for SPA routing
# Add this to your nginx server block:

# location / {
#   try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
# }

# For Node.js/Express server fallback
# app.get('*', (req, res) => {
#   res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist/index.html'));
# });

# This file ensures that all deployment platforms understand
# that this is a Single Page Application (SPA) that requires
# client-side routing support.

# Routes that should be handled by the client:
# /farmer-login
# /dealer-login  
# /admin-login
# /farmer/dashboard
# /dealer/dashboard
# /admin/*
# /farmer/*
# /dealer/*
# And all other React Router routes
