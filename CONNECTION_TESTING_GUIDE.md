# Connection System Testing Guide

## üîç How to Test the Connection System

### Step 1: Check Your User Identity
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/connection-test`
2. Check which user you're logged in as
3. Compare with Firebase data to understand what you should see

### Step 2: Test Dashboard Views
**As a Dealer** (login as dealer user):
- Go to `/dealer/dashboard`
- Should see connected farmers in the "Farmer Connection System" card
- Should see stats updated with real farmer data

**As a Farmer** (login as farmer user):
- Go to `/farmer/dashboard`  
- Should see connected dealers in the "Connected Dealers" card
- Should see dealer rates and information

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab to see:
- Real-time database queries
- User authentication details
- Connection data being loaded
- Any errors or issues

### Step 4: Test New Connections
1. **Generate Invitation Code** (as dealer):
   - Go to dealer dashboard
   - Click "Generate New Code" in the invitation card
   - Copy the generated code

2. **Use Invitation Code** (as farmer):
   - Go to `/farmer-connect`
   - Enter the invitation code
   - Login/register if needed
   - Should automatically connect

## üìä Current Firebase Data Status

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**If dashboards show "No farmers/dealers":**
1. Check console logs for user ID
2. Verify you're logged in as the correct user
3. Check Firebase collections match your user ID
4. Use the `/connection-test` page to debug

**If invitation codes don't work:**
1. Check code format and expiration
2. Verify user authentication
3. Check console for validation errors
4. Try generating a new code

**If data doesn't update:**
1. Check Firebase Rules allow read/write
2. Verify internet connection
