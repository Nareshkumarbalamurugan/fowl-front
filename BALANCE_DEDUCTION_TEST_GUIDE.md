# 🧪 Balance Deduction Testing Guide

## Current Issue
After dealer approves order, the amount is not being deducted from Firebase/farmer dashboard.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Order Approval Flow**: Changed from `approved` → `completed` to direct `completed` status
2. **Added Extensive Debugging**: Console logs throughout the transaction process
3. **Created Test Script**: Real-time monitoring of balance changes
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting

## 📋 Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Open Test Script
```
URL: http://localhost:5173/test-ledger.html
```

### Step 2: Start Monitoring
1. Click "Monitor All Balances" 
2. Click "Monitor All Transactions"
3. Click "Monitor Orders"
4. Leave this tab open to watch real-time changes

### Step 3: Run Migration (if not done)
```
URL: http://localhost:5173/migrate-balances.html
Action: Click "Start Migration"
```

### Step 4: Test Dealer Deposit
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/dealer/orders`
2. Login as dealer
3. Go to "Farmer Account Management" tab
4. Click "Add Payment" for a farmer
5. Deposit ₹10,000
6. **Watch test script tab** - Should show balance update

### Step 5: Test Order Approval
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/farmer/dashboard`  
2. Login as farmer
3. Place an order with the dealer (₹5,000 worth)
4. Switch back to dealer dashboard
5. Find the new order and click "Quick Approve"
6. Enter estimated cost: ₹5,000
7. Click "Respond to Order"
8. **Watch test script tab** - Should show:
   - New transaction (debit)
   - Balance update (reduced by ₹5,000)

### Step 6: Verify in Browser Console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for these log messages:
   ```
   🏦 Creating accounting transaction for order:
   💰 Processing debit transaction: ₹5000
   🔄 Starting addFarmerTransaction:
   🔒 Inside Firestore transaction...
   ✅ Transaction and balance updated successfully
   ```

### Step 7: Check Farmer Dashboard
1. Go to farmer dashboard
2. Check "Account Management" tab
3. Balance should be reduced from ₹10,000 to ₹5,000
4. New transaction should appear in history

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

### If Balance Not Updating:

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for error messages
   - Check if transaction logs appear
   - Verify Firebase connection

2. **Check Test Script**:
   - Are real-time updates showing?
   - Are new transactions appearing?
   - Are balance changes reflected?

3. **Check Firestore Console**:
   - Go to Firebase Console
   - Check `farmerBalances` collection
   - Check `farmerTransactions` collection
   - Verify data is being written

4. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open F12 → Network tab
   - Look for Firestore API calls
   - Check for any failed requests

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| No console logs | Code not reaching transaction | Check order approval flow |
| Firestore errors | Permission issues | Check temporary rules are active |
| Balance exists but not updating | Subscription issues | Refresh both dashboards |
| Transaction created but balance not calculated | Atomic transaction failure | Check console for runTransaction errors |

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful order approval:

1. **Console Logs**:
   ```
   🏦 Creating accounting transaction for order: {...}
   💰 Processing debit transaction: ₹5000
   🔄 Starting addFarmerTransaction: {...}
   ✅ Transaction and balance updated successfully
   ```

2. **Test Script Shows**:
   ```
   🔄 Transaction collection changed
   ADD: debit ₹5000 - Order completed: ...
   🔄 Balance collection changed  
   MODIFIED: farmer123_dealer456 = ₹5000
   ```

3. **Farmer Dashboard**:
   - Balance reduced by order amount
   - New transaction in history
   - Real-time update (no refresh needed)

4. **Dealer Dashboard**:
   - Farmer's balance shows new amount
   - Order status shows "Completed"

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
2. **Restart Development Server**
3. **Re-run Migration**
4. **Check Firebase Rules** - ensure temporary rules are active
5. **Verify User Authentication** - must be logged in properly
