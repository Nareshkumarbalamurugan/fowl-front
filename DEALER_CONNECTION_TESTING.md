# Dealer Connection Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you test the dealer-farmer connection functionality that was fixed in the recent update.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test the "Create Demo Data" Button
1. Log in as a dealer user
2. Navigate to the dealer dashboard
3. Click on the "Create Demo Data" button in the Quick Actions section
4. You should see a toast notification confirming the creation of demo data
5. Check the "Farmers" tab to see if demo farmers appear

### 2. Test Generating and Using an Invite Link
1. Log in as a dealer user
2. Navigate to the dealer dashboard
3. Click on the "Generate Invite Code" button or "Add Farmer" button
4. A modal will appear with both a code and a shareable link
5. Copy the link
6. Open a new browser window in incognito/private mode
7. Paste the link in the address bar
8. Log in as a farmer (or create a new farmer account)
9. The system should automatically connect the farmer to the dealer
10. You should see a success message and be redirected to the farmer dashboard

### 3. Verify Connections
1. After connecting, log back in as the dealer
2. Check the "Farmers" tab in the dealer dashboard
3. The newly connected farmer should appear in the list
4. Log in as the connected farmer
5. The dealer should be visible in the farmer's connections

## Troubleshooting
If connections aren't working:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the invite code is valid and not expired
3. Ensure both dealer and farmer are properly logged in
4. If using the "Create Demo Data" function, wait a few seconds for the data to be processed

## Technical Implementation Details
The recent fixes addressed the following:

1. **Shareable Links**: Now generating proper shareable links in addition to invite codes
2. **URL Parameter Handling**: FarmerConnect component now reads the code from URL parameters
3. **Demo Data Creation**: Improved to properly create connections between dealers and demo farmers
4. **Connection Validation**: Added checks to prevent duplicate connections
5. **User Interface**: Enhanced the dealer dashboard with better guidance and feedback

All these changes make the connection process more reliable and user-friendly.
